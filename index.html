          <span class="bold">HTTP</span> (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an
          application-layer protocol used for transmitting hypermedia documents,
          such as HTML. It is the foundation of data communication on the World
          Wide Web and facilitates the exchange of information between web
          servers and clients. HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that
          each request is independent and has no knowledge of previous requests.

          <h2>Request Methods</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          HTTP defines several request methods, also known as verbs, to indicate
          the desired action to be performed on the resource. The most commonly
          used methods are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">GET</span>: Retrieve a resource or a
            representation of it.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">POST</span>: Submit an entity to be processed by
            the resource identified by the URI. Typically used to create new
            resources, or to update existing ones with partial data.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">PUT</span>: Replace the entity of the resource
            identified by the URI with the supplied entity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">DELETE</span>: Delete the resource identified by
            the URI.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">HEAD</span>: Retrieve the headers of the
            resource, without the body.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">OPTIONS</span>: Retrieve the allowed methods and
            other capabilities of the server for the resource identified by the
            URI.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">PATCH</span>: Apply a partial update to the
            entity of the resource identified by the URI.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          HTTP also supports several other less commonly used methods, such as
          <span class="bold">CONNECT</span>, <span class="bold">TRACE</span>,
          and <span class="bold">LINK</span>.

          HTTP request headers provide additional information about the request
          being made. Some commonly used headers include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Accept</span>: Indicates the media type(s)
            accepted by the client. This can be used to request a specific
            representation of a resource, such as JSON or XML.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Content-Type</span>: Indicates the media type of
            the request entity (payload) being sent to the server. For example,
            <code class="inline-code">application/json</code> or
            <code class="inline-code">application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Authorization</span>: Provides authentication
            credentials for the request. This can be used to authenticate the
            client making the request, or to provide access tokens for
            authorized API requests.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">User-Agent</span>: Identifies the client software
            making the request. This can be used by servers to tailor their
            responses to specific clients (such as mobile devices), or to track
            usage statistics.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          There are many other headers that can be used in HTTP requests, such
          as <code class="inline-code">Cache-Control</code>,
          <code class="inline-code">If-Modified-Since</code>, and
          <code class="inline-code">Referer</code>. It is important to choose
          the appropriate headers for your use case, and to ensure that they are
          used consistently throughout your API.

        </header>
        <p>
          HTTP requests can include parameters, which provide additional
          information about the request. These parameters can be included in the
          URL, as query parameters, or in the request body, as form data or a
          JSON payload.
        </p>
        <section class="child-section">
          <h3>Query Parameters</h3>
          <p>
            Query parameters are included in the URL, after a question mark
            (<code class="inline-code">?</code>). They are used to filter or
            paginate a request, or to provide additional information about the
            requested resource. For example, a query parameter might be used to
            specify the number of results to return, or to search for resources
            matching a specific criteria.
          </p>
          <p>Here is an example of a URL with query parameters:</p>
          <pre>
            https://api.example.com/products?category=books&limit=10&page=2
          </pre>
          <p>
            In this example, the <code class="inline-code">category</code>,
            <code class="inline-code">limit</code>, and
            <code class="inline-code">page</code> parameters are included in the
            URL. The server can use these parameters to return a specific subset
            of the available resources.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="child-section">
          <h3>Request Body Parameters</h3>
          <p>
            Request body parameters are included in the request body, and can be
            sent as form data or a JSON payload. They are used to include more
            complex data in a request, such as a new resource to be created.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is an example of a JSON payload with request body parameters:
          </p>
          <pre>
            {
            &nbsp;&nbsp;"name": "New Product",
            &nbsp;&nbsp;"description": "A new product to be added to the catalog",
            &nbsp;&nbsp;"price": 19.99,
            &nbsp;&nbsp;"category": "books"
            }
          </pre>
          <p>
            In this example, the JSON payload includes the
            <code class="inline-code">name</code>,
            <code class="inline-code">description</code>,
            <code class="inline-code">price</code>, and
            <code class="inline-code">category</code> parameters. The server can
            use these parameters to create a new resource in the database.
          </p>

        <p>
          It is important to document the parameters supported by your API,
          including their names, types, and allowed values. You should also
          provide examples of how to include the parameters in your requests,
          and how the server will interpret them.

        <p>
          HTTP response status codes indicate the outcome of a request to the
          server. They are three-digit numbers that are grouped into five
          classes, according to their first digit:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">1xx (Informational)</span>: The request has been

          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">2xx (Success)</span>: The request has been
            successfully received, understood, and accepted.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">3xx (Redirection)</span>: Further action needs to
            be taken in order to complete the request.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">4xx (Client Error)</span>: The request contains
            bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled by the server.

        <p>Some commonly encountered HTTP response status codes include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">200 (OK)</span>: The request has succeeded. The

          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">204 (No Content)</span>: The request has
            succeeded and there is no response body.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">301 (Moved Permanently)</span>: The requested
            resource has been moved permanently to a new URL.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">302 (Found)</span>: The requested resource has
            been temporarily moved to a new URL.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">400 (Bad Request)</span>: The request contains
            bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled by the server.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">401 (Unauthorized)</span>: The request requires
            authentication, and the client has not provided valid credentials.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">403 (Forbidden)</span>: The server refuses to
            fulfill the request, usually because the client does not have
            sufficient permissions.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">404 (Not Found)</span>: The requested resource
            does not exist on the server.

        </ul>
        <p>
          It is important to understand the meaning of the different response

          <h2>Error Handling</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          When making HTTP requests, it is important to handle errors and status
          codes returned by the server properly. This ensures that your
          application can gracefully handle any issues that may arise during
          communication with the server. Here are some key points to consider
          when it comes to error handling:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">HTTP Status Codes</span>: HTTP status codes are
            three-digit numbers that indicate the outcome of an HTTP request.
            They provide information about whether the request was successful or
            encountered an error. Familiarize yourself with common status codes
            such as 200 (OK), 400 (Bad Request), 404 (Not Found), and 500
            (Internal Server Error).
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Error Response Formats</span>: Servers often send
            error responses in a specific format, such as JSON or XML, to
            provide additional details about the encountered error. When
            handling errors, it's crucial to parse and extract relevant
            information from these error response formats.
          </li>
          <li>
            <span class="bold">Handling Different Error Scenarios</span>:
            Different types of errors may occur during an HTTP request,
            including client-side errors (e.g., invalid input, authentication
            failures) and server-side errors (e.g., database connection issues,
            server timeouts). Your error handling logic should be able to
            differentiate between these scenarios and take appropriate actions.

            mechanism to report and log errors encountered during HTTP requests.
            This can help in troubleshooting and identifying patterns or
            recurring issues. Logging the details of the error, such as the
            error message, status code, and relevant request information, can
            assist in investigating and resolving problems.

          Authentication and Authorization are important aspects of secure
          communication between clients and servers in web applications. They
          ensure that only authorized users can access protected resources and
          perform specific actions.

          It's important to note that the specific implementation of
          authentication and authorization may vary depending on the server-side
          technologies and frameworks used in your application. Always refer to
          the documentation or guidelines provided by the service or platform
          you are working with for accurate and up-to-date instructions.
